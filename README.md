This example demonstrates a potential issue with mutable references in F#. When modifying a mutable variable through a reference, unexpected behavior can occur if not handled carefully. The code creates a mutable integer x and assigns its reference to y. Then, another mutable integer z is declared. After assigning x the value 3, the output shows that both x and the value pointed to by y are updated.
